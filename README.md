# Project 1 - Log-In-Activity

Log-In-Activity shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

* [ ] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
      * [ ] In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
      * [ ] In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

The following **optional** features was implemented:

* [ ] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.


## Notes

I was fairly successful in finding my way out to building this app. The only problem i have was when the final product was complete, it could not be displayed in the emulator. The app was working correctly in the emulator all along as i have build and run it periodically.
